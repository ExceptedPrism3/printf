# Printf | ALX â€¢ Software Engineer
This repository contains the implementation of the `printf` function as part of the ALX Software Engineer program. The implementation is done in C language, and the goal is to reproduce the behavior of the standard `printf` function.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExceptedPrism3/printf.git
```

## Prerequisites
To run the printf function, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have a C compiler installed, you can install GCC on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Installation
To install the printf function, simply include the "holberton.h" header file in your C program, and compile the program with the "holberton.c" source file.
